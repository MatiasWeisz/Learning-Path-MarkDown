## What is DNS?

![alttext](undraw_Domain_names_re_0uun.svg "DNS")

>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

- How does DNS work?
    - The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device - like a street address is used to find a particular home. When a user wants to load a webpage, a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser (example.com) and the machine-friendly address necessary to locate the example.com webpage.



## What is HTTP?
![alttext](undraw_server_q2pb.svg)
> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web

- Is used to load web pages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack.
- A typical flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.

## HTTP Methods
> Sometimes referred to as an HTTP verb

 - indicates the action that the HTTP request expects from the queried server.
    - Two of the most common HTTP methods are ‘GET’ and ‘POST’
    - A ‘GET’ request expects information back in return (usually in the form of a website), while a ‘POST’ request typically indicates that the client is submitting information to the web server
    
    
    
    
    
## What is CORS?
>CORS (cross-origin resource sharing)

 - A request for a resource (like an image or a font) outside of the origin is known as a cross-origin request.
    - Unlike same-origin, navigating to "https://www.ejemplo.com/hola.html" from URL1 could be allowed with CORS. Allowing cross-origin requests is helpful, as many websites today load resources from different places on the Internet (stylesheets, scripts, images, and more).
    - Cross-origin requests, however, mean that servers must implement ways to handle requests from origins outside of their own. CORS allows servers to specify who (i.e., which origins) can access the assets on the server, among many other things.


## What is RESTful?
>RESTful web services
 - RESTful are built to work best on the Web. Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that specifies constraints, such as the uniform interface, that if applied to a web service induce desirable properties, such as performance, scalability, and modifiability, that enable services to work best on the Web. In the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), typically links on the Web. The resources are acted upon by using a set of simple, well-defined operations
    
## What is a middleware?
>Middleware is software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it.
- Essentially functioning as hidden translation layer, middleware enables communication and data management for distributed applications. It’s sometimes called plumbing, as it connects two applications together so data and databases can be easily passed between the “pipe.”

## What is NPM, NVM and YARN?
>NPM short for Node Package Manager

- npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.
-  It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. 

>NVM short for Node Version Manager
- nvm is a version manager for node.js, designed to be installed per-user, and invoked per-shell. nvm works on any POSIX-compliant shell (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash), in particular on these platforms: unix, macOS, and windows WSL.
>YARN
- YARN is a package manager for JavaScript.
- It reads from the package.json file, so it should work on any project that's already using npm. It's pretty speedy too. It took about 12 seconds.
 - With npm, it took almost two minutes. It puts its dependencies in Node modules, just like npm, so all your tooling should work the same.

## JSON
>JavaScript Objet Notation
- Its a Data Representation Format
- Commonly used for APIs and Configs
- Its used becouse its extremely lightweight to send back and forth and its easy to read/write
>JSON Types
- JSON supports almost any datatype such as:

    - Strings ("Hello World, "John", "J")
    - Numbers ("10", "1.5", "-30", "1.2e10")
    - Booleans (True or False)
    - Null (Essentialy stands for nothing)
    - Arrays [1,2,3; "Hello","World"]
    - Objects {"key": "value"} {"age": 24}
